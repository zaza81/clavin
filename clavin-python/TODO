# Clavin class  
# should be extensible to use user auths, ssl, and different 
# transport mechanisms (RPC) and data formats (protobufs) and
# different protocol versions

# connect with no auth, non-ssl, using the default REST API 
clv = Clavin("http://localhost:9000") 


# parse  
# resolve 

# document is file-like object or string made up of text  
locs = clv.parse(document) 
# returns an iterable collection of location objects (these are not resolved)

# resolve can take a file-like object or string, in this case it will both 
# parse and resolve 
# if it takes a collection of parsed location objects, it will resolve those 
res = clv.resolve(document) 

# returns resolved locations
